# Commands to run on valid requests (optional, in addition to BetterTeams logic).
# Available built-in placeholders here:
#   %player_name%   - player name from the request
#   %player_uuid%   - player UUID from the request
#   %streamer%      - resolved streamer (from mapping below or request payload)

# Example:
# streamer-mappings:
#   "aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee": "SomeStreamer"
streamer-mappings: {}

# Streamer to Nation mapping used for BetterTeams integration.

# streamer-nations:
#   "Streamer name": "Nation name"
#   deehain: "Nation name"
streamer-nations: {}
